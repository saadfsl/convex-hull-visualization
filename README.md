# Convex Hull Visualization and Benchmarking

This project implements and visualizes three convex hull algorithmsâ€”**Jarvis March**, **Graham Scan**, and **Chan's Algorithm**. It supports benchmarking the algorithms and visualizing their step-by-step construction for various dataset distributions.

- Compatible with **Python 3.8** and above.
- Developed and tested on **Python 3.11**.

## Features
- Visualizations:
  - Animated and static plots.
  - Step-by-step animations for better understanding of algorithms.
- Algorithms:
  - Jarvis March
  - Graham Scan
  - Chan's Algorithm
- Data Distributions:
  - Rectangular
  - Circular
  - Grid
  - Clustered
  - Gaussian
  - Spiral
- Benchmarking:
  - Compare algorithm performance across distributions and dataset sizes.
  - Generates a CSV file with benchmark results.
